Elements of game design :
decunstructing the game - ( breaking the game into smaller functionalities )
1. pc ( playing character - operated by player )
Npc ( non playing charater - operated by computer)
example : In the packman game pacman , ghosts - ( npc )

2. Goal : Every game should have a goal 
example : Pacman has to eat all the small dots and not get killed by the ghost

3. Rules : pacman moves by arrow keys
small yellow dots dissapear when pacman touches it
ghosts move randomly and chase behind pacman
pacman has 3 lives
When pacman eats the dots score increases


4. Rules should be balanced ( not too easy not too difficult )

5. Adaptivity
As the game progresses the speed of the game should increase 
Game can have different levels
Difficulty level should increase

6. Elements of chance vs Elements of skill
